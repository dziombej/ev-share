# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Hard rules

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead." (Full rationale in the 10x-cli lesson block below.)

## Project

EV Share is a peer-to-peer EV charging exchange: users register their own charging point (POC), log charging sessions for other users, and track a pure kWh balance (no money involved) between accounts. The product spec lives in `context/foundation/prd.md`; the stack decision record is `context/foundation/tech-stack.md`; the discovery notes behind both are `context/foundation/shape-notes.md`. The one domain invariant to preserve everywhere balances are touched (`prd.md` § Business Logic): every logged charging session must debit one user and credit another by the identical kWh amount — no drift.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start the dev server (Cloudflare `workerd` runtime via `wrangler`)
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` — ESLint (flat config, strict type-checked)
- `npm run format` — Prettier

Pre-commit hook (husky + lint-staged) runs `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.

No test runner is configured yet. `prd.md` § Forward: technical-roadmap requires at least one e2e test verifying the primary user flow (US-01) — this still needs to be added.

Requires Node v22.14.0 (`.nvmrc`). Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (needs Docker) — copy `.env.example` to `.env` (Node) and `.dev.vars` (Cloudflare local dev via `wrangler`). Deploy with `npx wrangler deploy`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint + build on push/PR to `master` and needs `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY` as repo secrets.

## Architecture

- **Astro 6, SSR (`output: "server"`), Cloudflare adapter** (`astro.config.mjs`) — pages render server-side per-request on Cloudflare Workers, not statically generated.
- **Auth**: Supabase via `@supabase/ssr`'s cookie-based server client (`src/lib/supabase.ts`). `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY` are declared through Astro's `env` schema as server-only secrets, never exposed to the client.
- **Route protection**: `src/middleware.ts` resolves the current user on every request and gates paths listed in its `PROTECTED_ROUTES` array (currently just `/dashboard`), redirecting unauthenticated requests to `/auth/signin`. Add new protected routes there, not per-page.
- **Auth API routes** (`src/pages/api/auth/{signup,signin,signout}.ts`) are form-POST endpoints, not JSON APIs — they redirect back to the originating page with `?error=<message>` on failure; errors are read from the query string (`src/components/auth/ServerError.tsx`), not thrown/caught client-side.
- **Degraded mode without Supabase**: `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY` are optional env fields. If unset, `src/lib/supabase.ts`'s `createClient` returns `null` instead of throwing, and `src/lib/config-status.ts` flags Supabase as unconfigured — auth routes and middleware both check for `null` and no-op/redirect accordingly rather than crashing.
- **Path alias**: `@/*` → `src/*` (`tsconfig.json`).
- **UI**: Astro components for layout/structure, React islands for interactive pieces (forms under `src/components/auth/`), Tailwind 4 + shadcn-style primitives (`src/components/ui/`, `components.json`, "new-york" variant — add new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add <name>`). Merge/condition Tailwind classes through the `cn()` helper in `src/lib/utils.ts`, not manual string concatenation.
- **API routes**: export uppercase HTTP-verb handlers (`GET`, `POST`, ...) and `const prerender = false`; validate input with zod.
- **Supabase migrations** (once added) go in `supabase/migrations/` named `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`, with RLS enabled and granular per-operation/per-role policies on every new table.
- **Code placement**: shared types/entities/DTOs in `src/types.ts`; services/business logic in `src/lib/` (or `src/lib/services/` once it grows); extracted React hooks in `src/components/hooks/`.

## Current state

This is a freshly bootstrapped starter (scaffold log: `context/changes/bootstrap-verification/verification.md`). `src/pages/index.astro` still renders the starter's own `Welcome` component, not EV Share's actual landing page (balance, transaction history, available-POC list per the PRD). None of the EV Share domain logic — POCs, balances, charging sessions — exists yet; only the starter's auth scaffolding does.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 4

Onboard the agent to the project you scaffolded in Lesson 3 with the **agent-context chain**:

```
(/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd  →  /10x-tech-stack-selector  →  /10x-bootstrapper)  →  /10x-agents-md  →  /10x-rule-review  →  /10x-lesson
```

The PRD → tech-stack → bootstrap chain ships from Lessons 1–3 (re-included so you can fix the project mid-flight). `/10x-agents-md`, `/10x-rule-review`, and `/10x-lesson` are the lesson's main topics. The chain extends in Lesson 5 to the infra/deploy step.

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent context (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-agents-md` | The repo is scaffolded but the agent has no project-specific onboarding. Inspects the repo (package manifest, README, scripts, lint/test config, layout, commit history) and writes a concise, ordered "Repository Guidelines" to `AGENTS.md` (or, when invoked from a subdirectory, a directory-level `AGENTS.md` reframed around local conventions and the dominant unit). Use as an alternative to the host's built-in `/init` or as a fallback for tools without one. Repo-level body targets ~200 lines; directory-level guides target 120–250 words. |
| `/10x-rule-review <path>` | You have a rules-for-AI file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.windsurfrules`, nested per-area files) and want a 5-axis scorecard: length, embedded code/config snippets, precision of language, redundancy with public knowledge, and rule ordering. Tool-agnostic — scores the artifact's condition, not the project. Default output is read-only; only Check 5 (reorder) may edit, and only with explicit approval. |
| `/10x-lesson [seed]` | You spotted a recurring rule worth surfacing for future runs of `/10x-frame`, `/10x-research`, `/10x-plan`, `/10x-plan-review`, `/10x-implement`, and `/10x-impl-review`. Appends a single entry (Context / Problem / Rule / Applies to) to `context/foundation/lessons.md`. Self-bootstraps the file with the canonical `# Lessons Learned` header on first use. Append-only — never reorders or rewrites prior entries. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-init` / `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-stack-assess` / `/10x-health-check` | Bundled so you can fix the PRD, swap the stack, or re-scaffold mid-flight. If `/10x-rule-review` flags a `FAIL` you can't shrink your way out of, that often points back to ambiguous PRD or stack decisions — re-run the upstream skill rather than padding `AGENTS.md` with corrections. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-agents-md` writes (or surgically updates) `AGENTS.md` at the resolved scope. Repo-level scope = the file lives at the repo root and frames the project as a whole; directory-level scope = the file lives next to the code it governs and reframes around the local unit, dropping repo-wide framing entirely. The skill never silently overwrites — it switches to an update flow when the target exists.
- `/10x-rule-review` reads any rules-for-AI markdown file you point it at and prints a 5-check scorecard (`OK` / `WARN` / `FAIL`) with concrete fixes. It does not depend on `/10x-agents-md` having run; you can review `.cursor/rules/`, copilot instructions, or a hand-written `CLAUDE.md` the same way.
- `/10x-lesson` self-bootstraps `context/foundation/lessons.md` on first use, then appends one Context/Problem/Rule/Applies-to entry per invocation. The file is consumed as a prior by the planning- and review-phase skills introduced later in the workflow — `/10x-frame`, `/10x-research`, `/10x-plan`, `/10x-plan-review`, `/10x-implement`, `/10x-impl-review`.

### What the lesson's skills capture (and what they do NOT)

- **`/10x-agents-md` captures**: project structure, build/test/lint commands actually present in scripts, commit conventions inferred from history, repo-specific tripwires the agent would otherwise miss, references to canonical files via `@`-paths instead of pasting their content. Directory-level scope additionally captures: local naming/layout patterns inferred from siblings, allowed/forbidden imports, the test pattern used by neighbours, and tripwires visible in the immediate area.
- **`/10x-agents-md` does NOT** paste in the contents of `tsconfig.json` / `eslint.config` / framework docs the agent already knows; it does NOT generate generic "write clean code" intentions; it does NOT replace the host's built-in `/init` when one exists — it's positioned as an alternative or fallback, not a default.
- **`/10x-rule-review` captures**: a length verdict (OK ≤ 200 non-empty lines, WARN 201–500, FAIL 501+), code/config blocks that should be `@`-references instead, vague-intention language, redundancy with framework docs the agent already has from training, and a Check 5 reorder proposal that surfaces critical rules to the top.
- **`/10x-rule-review` does NOT** edit the file by default; it does NOT score project content (architecture, stack choices) — it scores the rule artifact's condition; it does NOT generate a "fixed version" of the file (Check 5 may move sections with explicit approval, never rewrite rule wording).
- **`/10x-lesson` captures**: one entry per invocation with a short imperative H2 title (the title IS the rule), Context (subsystem / phase / file pattern, specific enough to pattern-match), Problem (what concretely breaks without the rule, ideally with a past incident), Rule (1–2 imperative sentences pasteable verbatim into a future review finding), Applies to (subset of `frame`, `research`, `plan`, `plan-review`, `implement`, `impl-review`, or `all`).
- **`/10x-lesson` does NOT** edit or remove existing lessons — the file is append-only by design (rewriting recurring rules without thought is the failure mode this convention prevents); it does NOT batch multiple rules per invocation; it does NOT pre-fill fields proactively (the user does the writing — that's the price of capturing rules outside a structured review).

### The inclusion test (the filter for AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md)

Before you add a rule to any rules-for-AI file, ask: *could the agent know this without this file? Could public training data — books, blogs, repos in this stack — have prepared it for this?* If yes, drop it. If no, keep it. The file is onboarding for an agent that already knows TypeScript / Python / your framework but does NOT know your local conventions.

Belongs:
- non-obvious project conventions (error-response shape, file naming, allowed import paths)
- project-specific traps and "embarrassing" workarounds tied to history or dependency bugs
- referenced canonical files via `@`-paths (e.g. `@src/features/users/user.service.ts` as a pattern reference, not pasted code)

Does NOT belong:
- mainstream framework documentation
- README content the agent will read anyway (link with `@README.md`)
- popular generic advice ("use TypeScript strict mode") that's already enforced by config
- intention statements ("write clean code", "follow good practices") — convert to a checkable behaviour or drop

### U-shaped attention and granular rules

LLMs attend most strongly to the start and end of context (Lost-in-the-Middle / U-shaped attention). A long monolithic `CLAUDE.md` puts its middle rules in the weakest attention zone. Two practical consequences:

1. **Most important rules go to the top** of any rule file.
2. **Per-area rules belong next to their code** — nested `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` inside `src/api/`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` with file globs, etc. Granular files are loaded selectively and arrive whole near the start of their own section, instead of being buried at line 400 of one big file.

`/10x-rule-review` Check 5 (reorder) operationalizes consequence (1); the inclusion test plus directory-level `/10x-agents-md` operationalizes consequence (2).

### The five-pattern calibration drill

Before writing a rule, validate that the agent actually breaks the convention without it. Pick one pattern from your project (error-response shape, file naming, import style, module structure, date handling). Then:

1. Ask the agent to implement against the pattern 3–5 times from a clean state, no rule.
2. Note where it broke the convention; capture run time, files explored, and visible cost/tokens if the host surfaces them.
3. Add a 1–3-sentence rule to the appropriate scope (root or area-level).
4. Re-run the same task in a fresh session and compare convention adherence, time, files, and iterations.

If the agent already trends toward the convention without the rule, you don't need the rule. If it systematically picks the wrong pattern, you've found a high-leverage rule to add. This drill is what "earning a rule from a recurring failure" actually looks like.

### Hierarchy and tool interop

- **Claude Code** loads `CLAUDE.md` from the user dir (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`), the repo root, and any subdirectory the agent works under. Deeper files override or supplement higher ones.
- **Codex** and **GitHub Copilot** load `AGENTS.md` from the current directory upward — closest file wins.
- One canonical file is preferable to three duplicates. A common pattern: `AGENTS.md` as source of truth, `CLAUDE.md` as a thin Claude-Code shim with `@AGENTS.md` import, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` only if Copilot needs its own additions. Symlink (`ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`) is the simplest deduplication when tools require both names.
- Auto-memory (e.g. Claude Code's `~/.claude/projects/<dir-with-slashes-as-dashes>/memory/MEMORY.md`) is local to the machine and not a substitute for `AGENTS.md`. Team-binding rules live in the repo; auto-memory is a personal cache, periodically reviewable.

### Inner-loop hooks (deterministic feedback without prompting)

Mechanical, non-pickable checks belong in hooks (e.g. Claude Code's `PostToolUse`), not in the rule file. The agent finishes an edit; a formatter or fast lint runs; the result feeds back without you reminding it. Settings template (`settings.json.template`) ships in the lesson pack as the wiring entry point. Keep procedural workflows (deeper review, release checklist, deploy on sandbox) in skills, and reserve hooks for deterministic tool signals.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (and per-area variants) — `/10x-agents-md` output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — `/10x-lesson` output (append-only register, consumed by future planning/review skills)
- `context/foundation/prd.md`, `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — inputs from earlier lessons, still present
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry (scaffolded by `/10x-init`)

### Universal language

The shipped skills carry no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. `/10x-agents-md` discovers from the repo it's invoked in; `/10x-rule-review` is tool-agnostic and treats every file as "a rules-for-AI artifact"; `/10x-lesson` writes one entry shape regardless of project domain. The 5-pattern calibration drill is illustrative — substitute patterns from your own stack.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
